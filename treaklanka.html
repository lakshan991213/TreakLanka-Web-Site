	<p>I had the most amazing 3 week trip ever to Sri Lanka (November 2008) . The island really does have so much to offer - nature, amazing beaches and countryside, beautiful wildlife, the most incredibly interesting historical and religious sites, wonderful food, good choice of accommodation to suit all budgets... I could go on and on! Undoubtedly the best way to see the country is to hire a guide and/or driver - it's the fastest way to cover a lot of ground and see all the sites but more importantly, it's how you are most likely to gain a true insight into the Sri Lankan way of life and the lovely Sinhalese people! I spent much of my time with Saminda Kumara, a guide I met in Kandy. Together with Indu, a fantastic driver, we travelled around much of the country and had so many good times on the way. Although we also used trains and buses a fair amount of time too (as they are quite an experience, super cheap, and not to be missed!). One of the most memorable evenings was in a little hut on a beach in the south, sharing a huge barbecued fish, drinking, making music and singing with a bunch of fishermen who were about to head off to sea for 3 months!

	<p>We were greeted at Colombo Airport by Raj, he was to be our driver and guide for the whole of the tour. After a short drive to our first Hotel we spent the rest of the day on the beach, a welcome break after such a long journey.
The hotel, (Goldi Sands), was well run and the staff were pleasant and efficient.
Day 2, we drove to Kithugala Resthouse and after lunch we had a jungle walk, The walk was quite strenuous, due to the humidity , as we were not yet ,acclimatised, and even Raj and the guide for the walk suggested that we phone for a Tuc Tuc towards the end. Still, very enjoyable.
Day 3 was White Water Rafting, followed by a trip to Uda Walawe Elephant Transit Camp, it was a joy to see the young elephants running , two by two, to get their milk .</p>

	<p>I was in Sri Lanka for a week in end of Feb, 2009. This is my third trip there. The last time was there was in 2002, which I enjoyed very much. The place has changed considerably. I've been to many places but this was the worst trip I ever took.

It took almost 2 hours to get to the hotel from the airport, whereas it used to take only 20mins in my previous trips. There were army checkpoints every 500m. The taxi driver had to stop the car and provide ID and answer questions at every single check points. It was very annoying and made me feel unsafe.</p>
